# jmnote.github.io

Source repository for [jmnote.github.io](https://jmnote.github.io), a small
static profile page hosted on GitHub Pages.

The page content lives in [`index.html`](index.html). This README is intended
for people working on or deploying the repository.

## Run locally

The page is plain HTML and CSS, with a small JavaScript file for theme
switching. Run the repo-order, Markdown, HTML, and link checks locally
with:

```sh
make checks
```

To start a local server with live reload:

```sh
make serve
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000`.
